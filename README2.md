>7. i have done the second question in Task 2 in c++. the file is named node3.cpp 
>8. for the python files u might have to make it executable first by going to the directory or folder in which the file is placed then run the command

Bonus Section:
>1. the python file for the first question is "road.py". it's incomplete but i spent a lot of time on this and tried a lot of different approaches. ðŸ˜ž
>2. the document for the section is "sponsor.docx". i have no idea what a sponsor actually does so i just went with my gut. 
>3. i didn't do the third question cause i don't know how to use any designing software but i can learn in a few days if you guys select me ðŸ™‚
